# CrossarmMaskNN
A exploratory project on making a crossarm detection system with NN, neural networks.

Currently, the model used is called Mask RCNN, its Github repository can be found [here][1] 
and its paper can be found [here][2]. I do not claim to develop any of the software for the
model. I am just using the model for my crossarm detection application.
